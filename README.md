### Betamatch data

betamatch repo: https://github.com/FINNGEN/betamatch/

This repo contains the hand-curated external study data for matching effect sizes between variants in FinnGen and other (external) studies. The [metadata.txt file](https://github.com/FINNGEN/betamatch-ext-data/blob/master/metadata.txt) indicates in column `betamatch` for each file whether it can be used for `betamatching` or only for novelty reporting in [autoreporting](https://github.com/FINNGEN/autoreporting/).
